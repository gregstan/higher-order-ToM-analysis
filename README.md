# ToM+ Analysis — Strategic Reasoning Under Pressure

Minimal, reproducible analysis code for:
**Stanley (2025). Strategic Reasoning Under Pressure: Testing Heuristics in Higher-order Theory of Mind (Cognition).**

This repo contains:
- `Higher_order_ToM_Analysis_Stanley.py` — main analysis script (end‑to‑end)
- `GameTree.py` — small dependency used by a subsection of the analysis
- `Data/` — input data (place your CSVs here)
  - `Data/Raw/`   — raw inputs (provided in the repo)
  - `Data/Clean/` — merged/cleaned inputs (e.g., `Morality_Game_Study_Results_Higher_ToM_Merged.csv`)
- `Output/` — tables/CSVs generated by the script
- `Figures/` — plots generated by the script

> **Note:** simulation iterations are set to `1_000` for speed. Increase to `1_000_000` in the script (comment near `n_iters_per_simulation`) for full replication.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1) (Optional) Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 2) Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3) Data layout
# Raw study files go under ./Data/Raw/
# A merged/cleaned CSV is expected at ./Data/Clean/Morality_Game_Study_Results_Higher_ToM_Merged.csv
# (If it doesn't exist, the script will create it from raw files where applicable.)

# 4) Run the analysis
python Higher_order_ToM_Analysis_Stanley.py
